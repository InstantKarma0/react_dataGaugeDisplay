# react_dataGaugeDisplay

This Project is a data displayer, it visualizes the data using gauges to quickly see if the current data is near the max or the min.

The Projet use mock data, but i'm currently making an API with ExpressJs in order to store data and feed this project.   
It's made as a Single Page Application from React.   
The color theme of the backgrounds/font and the color of the gauge can be change using a Theme Context.   

Next things I plan to do with this project is to add graphics when the user clicks on a gauge in order to see the evolution of the data within hours/days.
